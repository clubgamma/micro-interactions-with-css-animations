### How to submit your work üìù


### 1. Create the folder Animations/YOUR-USERNAME/ 
Fork this repository, create a new folder inside the `Animations` folder, and name it with your username. It should look something like this `Animations/<YOUR-USERNAME>/`. 
Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with your GitHub username in this repo.

Ex.
```
Animations/clubgamma/
```

### 2. Add your CSS animations to the folder
  - Enter the folder you just created and add a README file in which you have to put your details. It should look something like this `Animations/clubgamma/<FILENAME>.md`

    Replace `<FILENAME>` with your GitHub username

    Ex.
    ```
    Animations/clubgamma/clubgamma.md
    ```

    Copy the below template into your file, delete the boilerplate data and fill the information with yours.
    ```
    name: CLUB GAMMA
    institution: CHARUSAT 
    email_id: gce@charusat.edu.in
    github_user: clubgamma
    ```

  - After that add the files that you created for animations (i.e. CSS/HTML files). Make sure that the name of html file must be **index.html**. other than this won't be accepted. For other files like CSS files you can name them as you like.
  
    Ex. 
    ```
    Animations/clubgamma/index.html [This file is compulsory]
    Animations/clubgamma/<FILENAME>.css
    ```

### 3. Create Pull Request:

You are about to submit your work. If you are done with the above steps then commit the changes and create pull request. While creating pull request enter your GitHub username as **title of pull request** and wait for some time to get it merged by us.
