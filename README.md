### How to submit your work 📝


### 1. Create the folder Animations/YOUR-USERNAME/ 
Fork this repository, create a new folder inside the `Animations` folder, and name it with your username. It should look something like this `Animations/<YOUR-USERNAME>/`. 
Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with your GitHub username in this repo.

Ex.
```
Animations/clubgamma/
```

### 2. Add your CSS animations to the folder
  - Enter the folder you just created and add a README file in which you have to put your details. It should look something like this `Animations/clubgamma/<FILENAME>.md`

    Replace `<FILENAME>` with your GitHub username

    Ex.
    ```
    Animations/clubgamma/clubgamma.md
    ```

    Copy the below template into your file, delete the boilerplate data and fill the information with yours.
    ```
    name: CLUB GAMMA
    institution: CHARUSAT 
    email_id: gce@charusat.edu.in
    github_user: clubgamma
    ```

  - After that add the files that you created for animations (i.e. CSS/HTML files). Make sure that the name of html file must be **index.html**. other than this won't be accepted. For other files like CSS files you can name them as you like.
  
    Ex. 
    ```
    Animations/clubgamma/index.html [This file is compulsory]
    Animations/clubgamma/<FILENAME>.css
    ```
